# Ideas for the Org Overview
- Build Stats?
  - Average build times
  - Most recent failure or ... ?
  - Average memory use over last X builds?
  - Expose if there is some large amount of time between builds, thinking of something like last build that was successful was 3 months ago, and recent builds are failing...expose that gap somehow so that users don't just think "last 2 builds were working but the most recnet one doesnt work"
- Link to Org Secrets
- Quick link to the Git org

- On overview page for pinned repos, how can users opt for which badge to show?
  - Repo settings page maybe?

- Audit Log
  - "User X just deleted secret"

- List all repos for the org
    - enabled? disabled? both? can you enable? let's find out

- IMO having some summary data is useful (and would be useful to have the same summery data on the "overview" page as well). I was just looking at an old Jenkins screen and I like how it has a consistent "job list" that shows status / volatility / last success / last failure / last duration.

# Considerations/Blockers
- Does "starring" a repo at an org level behave differently than for a user in their own space?
  - Maybe orgs have a list of common things they want everyone to see? IDK
